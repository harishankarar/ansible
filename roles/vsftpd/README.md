## Description

Briefly tell users why they might want to use your module. Explain what your
module does and what kind of problems users can solve with it.

This should be a fairly short description helps the user decide if your module
is what they want.

## Setup

### What ta_vsftpd affects **OPTIONAL**

If it's obvious what your module touches, you can skip this section. For
example, folks can probably figure out that your mysql_instance module affects
their MySQL instances.

If there's more that they should know about, though, this is the place to
mention:

* Files, packages, services, or operations that the module will alter, impact,
  or execute.
* Dependencies that your module automatically installs.
* Warnings or other important notices.

### Setup Requirements **OPTIONAL**

If your module requires anything extra before setting up (pluginsync enabled,
another module, etc.), mention it here.

If your most recent release breaks compatibility or requires particular steps
for upgrading, you might want to include an additional "Upgrading" section here.

### Beginning with ta_vsftpd

The very basic steps needed for a user to get the module up and running. This
can include setup steps, if necessary, or it can be an example of the most basic
use of the module.
